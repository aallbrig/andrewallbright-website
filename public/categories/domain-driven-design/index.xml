      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have discovered a technique that seems to help with project work. It is a combination of digital and physical. I call the technique the “Printable Project Notes technique.” Let me tell you how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The generic objective is to use your printer to create something that can help direct your project. The idea is that your screen real estate while doing project work is extremely valuable; wouldn’t it be nice to have something physical to reference?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
