      <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS GameLift is a cool product allowing game developers (hobbyist or professional) to develop multiplayer projects. You provide the game server executable and GameLift will take care of hosting the server processes, to your specifications. They even have a collection of features called “GameLift Anywhere” that supports a local development. Say you want to test some netcode you’ve written for your game, you’re using Unity, and you’ve already installed the GameLift unity plugin. Great! You can start your game server in your locally running Unity Editor and GameLift can know about the server there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>“Touch” as a guiding principle for Video Games</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/touch-as-a-guiding-principle-for-video-games/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good writing mostly follows the adage “show don’t tell” to help writers prioritize how they are conveying information. Perhaps video games should follow a “touch, don’t show” guiding light to help game developers convey experiences meaningful to the interactive medium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Robot Talk: The Future of Programming?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Large language models have hit the scene and they represent a large disruption to how work is traditionally done. Programming is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using LLMs like chatGPT and copilot for almost a year now. I saw potential of using the tool for my own creator activities. I have some thoughts on how AI may change the profession of programming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a quick aside I summarize my LLM usage in two broad categories: strategic versus tactical. Strategic questions represent research and design; chatGPT is excellent at serving this role. Tactical questions represent how to create or manipulate software to do what I want to do; both chatGPT and copilot fulfill this. I believe I am the entity that wants and the LLM tooling dutifully helps me get what I want.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hypothetical Course on Automated Testing for Video Games</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about what sort of information I’d want to see if I were watching an educational course on the topic of “automated testing for video games.” Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would assume a course would start out with the basics. Basics like &lt;em&gt;here is a test&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;here is how to come up with a assertion of software behavior&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;here is how to prioritize what automated tests to write&lt;/em&gt;. I would also presume the basics would simply new up ethereal game engine game objects and attach relevant game engine components to them (such as Unity’s MonoBehaviour components).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This very website faces a prolonged period of inactivity. I must admit that there appeared an error that I wasn’t able to resolve. Allow me to describe my previous setup so that you can understand the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I once had a desire to create a website for myself. I wanted to create a space on the internet to call my own. Previously I had created WordPress websites for others; surely I could create one for myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts on “Generative A.I.” LLMs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a long hiatus I am finally back. There is a story I can’t wait to tell. For now, lets talk about large language models (LLMs)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have given some thought to LLMs specifically on the source of data LLMs consume. For some context I heavily use chatGPT and GitHub copilot during my hobbyist development. I am impressed. I’ve thought about how these LLMs are trained. They are given access to content created largely through text, such as open source program source code available to anyone. I wondered what sort of impact LLMs tooling may have on the type of writing people do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wordsimples: inventing jargon by mashing together simple words</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I listen to people talk I notice some of the odd ways people use language. For example, I find it fun to sometimes imagine people literally doing the things they say they will do. When I hear “I’m going to run to the bathroom” I amuse myself imaging a full sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve noticed more of are what I call “&lt;em&gt;wordsimples&lt;/em&gt;.” A wordsimple is a mash up of two more common words to convey a more complex thing or meaning. &lt;em&gt;Wordsimple&lt;/em&gt; is itself meant to be a wordsimple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am still processing this information and so far I love what I see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing is a core tenant I believe helps me produce high quality software. In order to have faith in a test suite that is assembled is to constantly verify every code change that is introduced to the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Github Actions (&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;docs&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;) is a wonderful workflow based system that can easily integrate with a Github project. Since Github is my version control repository of choice, it is natural for me to adopt it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I mean to capture my current early 2022 thoughts on writing tests intended to be run by &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;automated processes&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; created for Unity based video games. I want to capture my thoughts so I can share this and receive feedback. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I haven’t found a holistic philosophy around testing. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I can be better. If you can help, please do!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;pit-stop-where-is-all-the-content.wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Pit stop: Where is all the content?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love researching topics, buying books, and seeing what content “influencers” say on topics. When I investigate this topic I find very little content. Are content creators disinterested in this topic? The ones that do create content seem to be stuck showing testing setup and trivial examples, such as testing a function that adds two numbers. I’m sure there is a deep dive out there but I can’t seem to find it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preamble.wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;Preamble&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over a year ago I was looking for a game engine to invest my time into. Before this I had relegated myself to making 2D games using python + pygame, javascript + phaser, and actionscript + flash. However; I wanted to upgrade from using game libraries into using a full on game engine. I want to know how to make 3D games as well!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I evaluated three engines: Unity, Unreal, and Godot. All three game engines offer similar features and at the time Unity was the only game engine that offered support for building something capable of running inside the browser. Being able to share my game over through the browser has always been a primary criteria for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I attended Global Game Jam 2022. If you don’t know what a game jam is, the programmer in me will say “it is a hackathon but your product is a video game.” How did I do? As a learning experience I am proud of what I was able to accomplish. However; I think there is an opportunity to reflect on why I didn’t end up with a finished product. This article is my retelling of this year’s Global Game Jam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had an interesting experience with web 3.0 over the past couple months where I’ve transitioned from being a believer to then becoming disillusioned with the concept. I think I’m at a point where I believe in the dream of web 1.0. I want to help create a world where most people are technical enough to host and maintain their digital presence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;believer&#34;&gt;Believer&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a programmer I love learning about new technologies. My social network and my (curated) media network started talking about web 3.0 technologies more and more. One of the “a-ha!” moments came from when I watched a couple videos by &lt;strong&gt;Fireship&lt;/strong&gt; which talks about web 3.0 trends.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At that bar is an arcade cabinet called Time Pilot. I had skipped over that cabinet quite a few times before I finally started playing it. The game is fun! It is relatively complex yet relatively simple. A gem from the 1980s!&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Early in college I wanted to be a digital artist so I taught myself how to create using computer drawing tablets. I never had a drawing tablet where I could draw directly onto the screen until now. I’ve learned how to use it in personal workflows when working on projects. I think type of laptop &amp;amp; drawing tablet setup should be standard for many types of creators.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have discovered a technique that seems to help with project work. It is a combination of digital and physical. I call the technique the “Printable Project Notes technique.” Let me tell you how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The generic objective is to use your printer to create something that can help direct your project. The idea is that your screen real estate while doing project work is extremely valuable; wouldn’t it be nice to have something physical to reference?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing an announcement about &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/&#34;&gt;AWS Cloud Shell&lt;/a&gt; December of 2020 but I did not explore it then. Instead I was focusing on my Unity learning path. Recently, I decided to use it when I had to fix the state of my AWS resources. This blog is meant to capture some of my thoughts and excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use Electronic Freedom Foundation (EFF)’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://certbot.eff.org/&#34;&gt;Certbot&lt;/a&gt; tool to handle SSL certification rotation (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-ssl-work/&#34;&gt;How does SSL work? by CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;, for the curious) directly on my AWS &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2&#34;&gt;EC2 instances&lt;/a&gt;. With my current setup, I need to intervene every so often (not great but good enough). This was what provided me the opportunity to explore AWS CloudShell months after its release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to get &lt;em&gt;so good&lt;/em&gt; at video game creation software that you can &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; create shareable media to communicate complex ideas to other people? What form does the shareable media take?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the excitement of video games is being able to see and interact with things I never would have imagined. It is absolutely surreal to have seen what I’ve seen. Video games are a triumph of human storytelling. This storytelling skill can be used in much broader contexts than they are today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing tests for software is important for multiple reasons. For me, testing increases velocity by removing the need for manual verification of a feature or bug fix. For me, testing takes on a form of documentation for my software. For me, testing lets me return to a project and get a little hit of dopamine as I see a set of passing tests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unity is a fantastic piece of software with an equally fantastic amount of warts. Those warts extend to testing. In my opinion, the developers of Unity consider testing a second class activity. In my opinion, the developers of Unity do not think their end users find value in testing. I believe the developers of Unity do not have their most highly talented engineers working on the testing story for Unity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since late December I have been learning video game development in earnest as a hobby. It is fun to consider the challenges of video games as software projects. This consideration lets me think about the end to end software lifecycle of video games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I enjoy playing video games as a hobby. As a kid I loved real time strategy (RTS) games and role playing games, often the ones created in Japan (JRPG). I enjoy the idea of being a creator of game worlds, at least as a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
