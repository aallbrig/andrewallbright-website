<p>I love researching topics, buying books, and seeing what content “influencers” say on topics. When I investigate this topic I find very little content. Are content creators disinterested in this topic? The ones that do create content seem to be stuck showing testing setup and trivial examples, such as testing a function that adds two numbers. I’m sure there is a deep dive out there but I can’t seem to find it.</p>

<p>Over a year ago I was looking for a game engine to invest my time into. Before this I had relegated myself to making 2D games using python + pygame, javascript + phaser, and actionscript + flash. However; I wanted to upgrade from using game libraries into using a full on game engine. I want to know how to make 3D games as well!</p>
<p>I evaluated three engines: Unity, Unreal, and Godot. All three game engines offer similar features and at the time Unity was the only game engine that offered support for building something capable of running inside the browser. Being able to share my game over through the browser has always been a primary criteria for me.</p>

      <p>I attended Global Game Jam 2022. If you don’t know what a game jam is, the programmer in me will say “it is a hackathon but your product is a video game.” How did I do? As a learning experience I am proud of what I was able to accomplish. However; I think there is an opportunity to reflect on why I didn’t end up with a finished product. This article is my retelling of this year’s Global Game Jam.</p>

      <p>I have had an interesting experience with web 3.0 over the past couple months where I’ve transitioned from being a believer to then becoming disillusioned with the concept.

<p>As a programmer I love learning about new technologies. My social network and my (curated) media network started talking about web 3.0 technologies more and more.

<p>I’m going to go to my local video game arcade bar to work on more Unity programming (aka “game” programming, although I feel silly saying that). At that bar is an arcade cabinet called Time Pilot. I had skipped over that cabinet quite a few times before I finally started playing it. The game is fun! It is relatively complex yet relatively simple. A gem from the 1980s!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I have discovered a technique that seems to help with project work. It is a combination of digital and physical. I call the technique the “Printable Project Notes technique.” Let me tell you how it works.</p>
<p>The generic objective is to use your printer to create something that can help direct your project. The idea is that your screen real estate while doing project work is extremely valuable; wouldn’t it be nice to have something physical to reference?</p>

      <p>Is it possible to get <em>so good</em> at video game creation software that you can <em>quickly</em> create shareable media to communicate complex ideas to other people? What form does the shareable media take?</p>
<p>Part of the excitement of video games is being able to see and interact with things I never would have imagined. It is absolutely surreal to have seen what I’ve seen. Video games are a triumph of human storytelling. This storytelling skill can be used in much broader contexts than they are today.</p>
