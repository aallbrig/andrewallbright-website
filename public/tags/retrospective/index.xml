      <description>&lt;p&gt;I attended Global Game Jam 2022. If you don’t know what a game jam is, the programmer in me will say “it is a hackathon but your product is a video game.” How did I do? As a learning experience I am proud of what I was able to accomplish. However; I think there is an opportunity to reflect on why I didn’t end up with a finished product. This article is my retelling of this year’s Global Game Jam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
