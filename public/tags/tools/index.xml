      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently purchased a &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Wacom One drawing tablet&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; from a local store. Early in college I wanted to be a digital artist so I taught myself how to create using computer drawing tablets. I never had a drawing tablet where I could draw directly onto the screen until now. Iâ€™ve learned how to use it in personal workflows when working on projects. I think type of laptop &amp;amp; drawing tablet setup should be standard for many types of creators.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
