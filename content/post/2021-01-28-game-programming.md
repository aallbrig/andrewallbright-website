Since late December I have been learning video game development in earnest as a hobby. It is fun to consider the challenges of video games as software projects. This consideration lets me think about the end to end software lifecycle of video games.

I enjoy playing video games as a hobby. As a kid I loved real time strategy (RTS) games and role playing games, often the ones created in Japan (JRPG). I enjoy the idea of being a creator of game worlds, at least as a hobby.

I chose Unity because it can produce build artifacts that can be played through the web. This is the killer feature when compared to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.unrealengine.com" target="_blank">Unreal Engine</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, which are comparable to Unity. Sharing with friends and family is much easier through the web. For example, check check my flavor of microFPS at here (microfps.andrewallbright.com).

Up until now I leaned on using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://learn.unity.com/" target="_blank">learn.unity.com</a>. On that site there are &#8220;pathways&#8221; were made to help newcomers. Now I research talks on programming topic on youtube and apply what I learn. For example, I find this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk" target="_blank">2017 talk on Scriptable Objects by Ryan Hipple</a> to be very compelling.

I learn that the Global Game Jam is like the Superbowl of game jams. I also learn the game jam for 2021 already started yesterday. Very tempting, indeed.
