Sometimes when I listen to people talk I notice some of the odd ways people use language. For example, I find it fun to sometimes imagine people literally doing the things they say they will do. When I hear &#8220;I&#8217;m going to run to the bathroom&#8221; I amuse myself imaging a full sprint.

One thing I&#8217;ve noticed more of are what I call &#8220;_wordsimples_.&#8221; A wordsimple is a mash up of two more common words to convey a more complex thing or meaning. _Wordsimple_ is itself meant to be a wordsimple.

I find that wordsimples are often created as meaningful jargon used in jobs. This may strike some as an interesting example. I would say that _<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushback" target="_blank">pushback</a>_ as an aviation term is a wordsimple, as it means to convey that one vehicle is pushing back an aircraft in preparation of departure.

I remember being tickled by the word _wormsign_ in _Dune (2021)_. I noticed it and thought that there was a certain authenticity to creating a wordsimple like this in a world with giant marauding sand worms.<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

In my life I&#8217;ll sometimes keep my hears perked up for more examples of wordsimples.
