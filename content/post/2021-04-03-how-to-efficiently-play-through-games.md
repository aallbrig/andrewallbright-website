If you want to experience a game but don&#8217;t have much time you may consider this advice. This recipe can be used to quickly play through a game.

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

First, find a speed run video of someone quickly beating your game.

Next, load up the game you want to play.

Watch the video showing how they beat a level of the game. Stop the video once it is clear they are at the end of the level.

Now play through the level and beat it yourself.

Repeat the &#8220;watch then play&#8221; routine until you have experienced the full game.

This recipe works for games with clear level segments but can be adapted to fit the type of game being played. I prefer to skip story exposition (where applicable) when watching the speed run.
